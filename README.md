# Segmenting and clustering neighborhoods in New York City

## Overview 
Segment the neighborhoods of New York City into separate clusters to help the people determining which neighborhood they should choose for their move in to this city.

## Data Sources
- NYC Neighborhood spatial information
- City Realty average housing prices Manhattan/Brooklyn July 2020
- Zumber median housing prices for Manhattan/Brooklyn Feb 2021
- NYC OPEN data (i.e. Crime rate, Population)
- Foursquare (Schools, hospitals, banks, bus stations, restaurants, bars)
